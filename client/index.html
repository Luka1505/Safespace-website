        <h2>About SafeSpace</h2>
        <p>
          SafeSpace is built for students who often hide their stress, anxiety, or fear behind a smile. 
          We believe that emotional expression is strength — not weakness. It was built for the students who laugh loudly in class and cry quietly in their room.
          For the ones who smile when they’re hurting, who stay silent when they need a hug.
          Here, you don’t need to explain. You just need to be. And that’s more than enough. Here, you're not alone. 
          You're not judged. You’re simply heard.
